# `@skyra/reddit-helpers`

Very basic Reddit helper functions for several ArchId bots to ensure we do not duplicate code.

Note that this package only does [Application Only Oauth](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2#application-only-oauth) and requires
an application of the "Installed" type!

## Features

-   Powered by the `@skyra/safe-fetch` package

## Usage

First of all, you should make sure to define the following environment variables for your process:

-   `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`: The Client ID of your Reddit application (generated at
    [Reddit Apps Dashboard](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/))
-   `REDDIT_DEVICE_ID`: A unique, per-device ID generated by your client.

After this, you can use the functions exported from this package to interact with the Reddit API.

### What value should I use for device_id?

You should generate and save unique ID on your client. The ID should be unique per-client. A randomized or pseudo-randomized value is acceptable for generating the ID; however, you should retain and re-use the same device_id when renewing your access token.
